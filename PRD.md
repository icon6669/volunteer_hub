### 11.2 Request/Response Formats

All API operations use the Supabase JavaScript client for database operations. Data is exchanged using TypeScript interfaces that map to the database schema.

**Example User Object**:
```typescript
{
  id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  image: "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
  userRole: "OWNER",
  emailNotifications: true,
  unreadMessages: 0,
  providerId: "google-oauth2|12345",
  created_at: "2025-03-15T10:30:00Z",
  updated_at: "2025-03-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Example Event Object**:
```typescript
{
  id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  name: "Beach Cleanup",
  description: "Community beach cleanup event",
  location: "Main Beach",
  startDate: "2025-04-15T09:00:00Z",
  endDate: "2025-04-15T12:00:00Z",
  ownerId: "7b44ab54-8c07-45a7-b736-3281730b6a18",
  roles: [
    {
      id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      name: "Team Leader",
      description: "Coordinate volunteers",
      capacity: 5,
      eventId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 11.3 Error Handling Standards

Error handling is implemented through try/catch blocks with consistent error logging:

```typescript
try {
  // API operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error in operation:`, error);
  throw error;
}
```

Errors from Supabase operations are propagated to the UI layer where they are displayed to users with appropriate context.

Common error scenarios:
- Authentication failures
- Permission denied (insufficient role)
- Resource not found
- Validation errors
- Database constraints (unique violations, foreign key constraints)

### 11.4 API Versioning Strategy

  - Performance budget adherence
  - Technical debt assessment

### 22.4 Staging/Production Environment Differences

- **Development Environment**:
  - Local Docker setup with Supabase hosted instance
  - Feature flags enabled for all in-development features
  - Verbose error messages and logging
  - Mock third-party integrations where appropriate

- **Staging Environment**:
  - Mirror of production configuration
  - Connected to separate Supabase project
  - Full data set with anonymized production data
  - Used for UAT and performance testing
  - All monitoring and alerting enabled

- **Production Environment**:
  - Optimized Docker configuration
  - Connected to production Supabase project
  - Strict security controls
  - Minimal logging of sensitive information
  - Feature flags controlled via admin interface

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Environment variables for all configuration
  - Secrets management via secure storage
  - Feature flag configuration per environment
  - Resource allocation appropriate to environment purpose

### 22.5 Rollback Procedures

- **Rollback Triggers**:
  - Error rate exceeds 5% of requests
  - Critical functionality unavailable
  - Security vulnerability discovered
  - Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
  - Explicit decision by authorized team members

- **Rollback Process**:
  1. **Decision**: Authorized team member initiates rollback
  2. **Execution**: Revert to previous known-good Docker image
  3. **Verification**: Run smoke tests on rolled-back version
  4. **Database**: Apply compensating transactions if needed
  5. **Notification**: Inform users of temporary service impact
  6. **Analysis**: Post-mortem investigation of root cause

- **Database Rollback Strategy**:
  - Point-in-time recovery for data corruption
  - Migration scripts include rollback procedures
  - Database snapshots before major changes
  - Transaction logs for fine-grained recovery

- **Recovery Time Objectives**:
  - Decision to rollback: Within 15 minutes of issue detection
  - Execution of rollback: Within 10 minutes of decision
  - Full service restoration: Within 30 minutes of issue detection
